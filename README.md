# Miscellaneous Overwatch Analysis

Repo holds various analysis done on overwatch. Most statistics pulled from (Winston's Lab)[https://www.winstonslab.com/]

## First Pick Analysis

See notebook `hero_death_analysis.ipynb`. Contains OWL teamfight analysis for fights after losing the first hero. There was lots of talk about how low the win percentage is after losing your Zarya and I was curious what the numbers were for all other heros. It seems like the win rate is similar for all tanks according to Winston's Lab teamfight data. On average if your team gets the first kill (in the current meta regardless of hero), you have an 88% chance of winning the teamfight.
